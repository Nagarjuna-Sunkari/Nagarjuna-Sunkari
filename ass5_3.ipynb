        "*   `if n == 0 or n == 1:`: **This is the base case.** In recursion, a base case is essential to stop the recursive calls. The factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1, so if `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 directly without making further recursive calls.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### How Recursion Works in this Function\n",
        "\n",
        "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in its definition. In the case of the factorial function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  When `recursive_factorial(n)` is called with `n > 1`, it doesn't immediately return a value.\n",
        "2.  Instead, it calls `recursive_factorial(n - 1)`.\n",
        "3.  This process continues, with each call calling the function with a smaller argument (`n - 2`, `n - 3`, and so on) until the base case is reached (`n` becomes 0 or 1).\n",
        "4.  When the base case is reached, the function returns `1`.\n",
        "5.  Then, the calls start returning values back up the chain. `recursive_factorial(2)` receives the result of `recursive_factorial(1)` (which is 1) and returns `2 * 1 = 2`.\n",
        "6.  `recursive_factorial(3)` receives the result of `recursive_factorial(2)` (which is 2) and returns `3 * 2 = 6`.\n",
        "7.  This continues until the original call `recursive_factorial(n)` receives the result of `recursive_factorial(n - 1)` and computes the final factorial value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The base case is crucial because it provides a stopping condition for the recursion. Without a base case, the function would keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Algorithm Flow Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "For a given non-negative integer `n`:\n",

        "1.  **Check for base case:** If `n` is 0 or 1, return 1.\n",
        "2.  **Check for invalid input:** If `n` is negative, raise a `ValueError`.\n",
        "3.  **Recursive step:** If `n` is greater than 1, multiply `n` by the result of calling the `recursive_factorial` function with `n - 1`.\n",
        "4.  The function repeatedly calls itself with decreasing values until the base case (0 or 1) is reached.\n",
        "5.  The results from the base case propagate back up through the chain of calls, performing the multiplication at each step, until the final factorial value for the original `n` is computed and returned.\n",

            "3.  This process continues, with each call calling the function with a smaller argument (`n - 2`, `n - 3`, and so on) until the base case is reached (`n` becomes 0 or 1).\n",
            "4.  When the base case is reached, the function returns `1`.\n",
            "5.  Then, the calls start returning values back up the chain. `recursive_factorial(2)` receives the result of `recursive_factorial(1)` (which is 1) and returns `2 * 1 = 2`.\n",
            "6.  `recursive_factorial(3)` receives the result of `recursive_factorial(2)` (which is 2) and returns `3 * 2 = 6`.\n",
            "7.  This continues until the original call `recursive_factorial(n)` receives the result of `recursive_factorial(n - 1)` and computes the final factorial value.\n",
