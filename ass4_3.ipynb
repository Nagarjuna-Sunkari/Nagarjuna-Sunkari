        "\n",
        "The function `count_lines_in_file(filename)` takes a filename as input and returns the number of lines in that file.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **File Handling:** It uses a `try...except` block to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` if the specified file doesn't exist.\n",
        "2.  **Opening the File:** Inside the `try` block, it opens the file in read mode (`'r'`) using a `with` statement. This ensures the file is automatically closed even if errors occur.\n",
        "3.  **Reading Lines:** `f.readlines()` reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file (including the newline character).\n",
        "4.  **Counting Lines:** `len(lines)` calculates the number of elements in the list, which corresponds to the number of lines in the file.\n",
        "5.  **Returning the Count:** The function returns the calculated line count.\n",
        "6.  **Error Handling:** If a `FileNotFoundError` occurs, the `except` block is executed, and an error message is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "The example demonstrates how to use the function with a dummy file named `example.txt`."
