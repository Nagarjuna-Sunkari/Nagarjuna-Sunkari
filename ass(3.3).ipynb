        "*   The `register_user` function successfully adds new users to the `users_db` if the username doesn't exist and returns a message if the user already exists.\n",
        "*   The `login_user` function authenticates users by checking if the username exists in `users_db` and verifying the provided password against the stored password. It returns specific messages for successful login, invalid password, or user not found.\n",

            "  - `output_unit`: The desired unit for the converted temperature ('C', 'F', or 'K').\n",
            "- **Input Validation:**\n",
            "  - It first checks if the `value` is a number (int or float) using `isinstance`. If not, it returns an 'Invalid temperature value.' error message.\n",
            "  - It standardizes `input_unit` and `output_unit` to uppercase using `.upper()` for case-insensitive unit checking.\n",
            "  - It checks if both `input_unit` and `output_unit` are within the `valid_units` list ('C', 'F', or 'K'). If either is invalid, it returns an 'Invalid unit specified. Use 'C', 'F', or 'K'.'.\n",
            "- **Handling Same Units:**\n",
            "  - If `input_unit` is the same as `output_unit`, the function directly returns the original `value` (converted to float) without performing any conversion, as requested by the prompt.\n",
            "- **Conversion Logic:**\n",
            "  - The core conversion logic first converts the `value` from the `input_unit` to Celsius (`celsius_value`). This acts as an intermediate step, simplifying the conversion process as all conversions can be done via Celsius.\n",
            "  - It then converts the `celsius_value` to the `output_unit` using the appropriate formula.\n",
            "- **Supported Conversions:** The code explicitly supports conversions between any combination of Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K) based on the provided formulas.\n",
            "- **Return Value:** Returns the calculated `converted_value` as a float or an error message string if input validation fails.\n",

            "How this code addresses limitations from the less specific prompt:\n",
            "- **Support for Multiple Units:** Unlike the previous version that only handled C to F and F to C, this code explicitly supports and converts between C, F, and K, as specified in the refined prompt.\n",
            "- **Clarity on Distinct Input and Output Units:** The prompt clearly defined `input_unit` and `output_unit` as separate parameters, and the code uses these to perform conversions from a specified input unit to a specified output unit, removing the ambiguity of the previous version.\n",
            "- **Handling of Same Input and Output Units:** The refined prompt specifically asked for this case to return the original value, which the generated code correctly implements.\n",

            "2. Input Handling and Clarity:\n",
            "   - **Less Specific Code:** Used a single 'unit' parameter, which was ambiguous regarding whether it represented the input unit or the desired output unit. Assumed the input was always a number.\n",
            "   - **Refined Code:** Uses distinct `value`, `input_unit`, and `output_unit` parameters. This clear separation makes the function's expected inputs and outputs explicit.\n",

            "3. Error Handling:\n",

            "   - **Refined Code:** Includes robust input validation for both the temperature `value` (checking if it's a number) and the `input_unit`/`output_unit` (checking if they are valid strings 'C', 'F', or 'K'). Provides specific, informative error messages for each case.\n",

            "   - **Less Specific Code:** Did not explicitly handle the case where the input and output units are the same.
